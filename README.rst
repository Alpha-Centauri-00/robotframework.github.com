Robot Framework ecosystem front page
====================================

This repository hosts Robot Framework's public website source code. The site
itself is available at http://robotframework.org.

All HTML content is in `<index.html>`__ file. CSS, images, and Javascript are
in `<css>`__, `<img>`__ and `<js>`__ folders. `<PIE.htc>`__ makes the site
work on older IE browsers and `<CNAME>`__ contains domain configuration.

Adding new links
----------------

To get new links added to the website, please use `the issue tracker`_ to submit
an issue about it. Please check beforehand that the link is not already on
the site. Search for the url as it might be with different name than what you
would assume.

Please detail the following information:

- Name of the library
- Short description (approximately 10 words)
- Link to the home page of the library (preferably just not the keyword documentation
  page)

We will to the best of our ability add new links as soon as possible.
