currently start processes using `stdin=subprocess.PIPE` by default. That typically works fine, but issue #4065 demonstrates it can cause problems with some processes. It would be better to use `stdin=None` by default. It would avoid problems like in #4065 and be the same as the default behavior of the underlying [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this change is that it can cause backwards compatibility problems. In most cases there's no difference, but in some case being able to write to the stdin of the started process can be handy. Our own acceptance tests use this functionality and it's possible/likely that also others are using it. We made stdin configurable in RF 4.1.2 (#4102) so if the pipe behavior is desired, `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly.\r\n\r\nI think we can change this already in RF 5.0 because it's unlikely many users are affected and `stdin=PIPE` can be used explicitly. Because `stdin=PIPE` only works with RF 4.1.2 and newer, we may want to wait until RF 5.1, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3187","id":444834531,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDQ4MzQ1MzE=","number":3187,"title":"Inline keyword call syntax","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2021-10-19T19:00:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T19:05:19Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":42,"created_at":"2019-05-16T08:58:20Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T14:12:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Having inline keyword call syntax would be nice. It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables). Example usages are listed below and possible syntax alternatives discussed in separate comments.\r\n\r\n1. Arguments to other keywords. At the moment you need to this in two steps:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ${result} =    Keyword    argument\r\n   Another Keyword    ${result}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In Python and other \"real\" programming languages you use something like `another_keyword(keyword('argument'))`, but in Robot's syntax\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   Another Keyword    Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n   is parsed as `Another Keyword` getting two arguments. This cannot be changed so new syntax is needed.\r\n\r\n2. Condition to the forthcoming `IF/ELSE` syntax (#3074). Currently (well, in the future once IF/ELSE is supported), you need to use:\r\n   ```\r\n   ${status} =    Keyword\r\n   IF    ${status}\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   and\r\n   ```\r\n   IF    Keyword\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   would be parsed as `Keyword` being the expression to evaluate.\r\n\r\n3. Similarly existing FOR loops would benefit from this.\r\n\r\n4. Inline keyword call syntax would also allow adding support to create variables in the `Variables` section based on keyword return values. Currently that's not possible at all, and creating suite level variables dynamically requires using Suite Setup. Being able to do something like this is a pretty common request:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   *** Variables ***\r\n   ${EXAMPLE} =         Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing related to this issue is coming up with a good syntax.

There are, however, various tools and libraries that use Robot's Python 2/3 compatibility layer and removing it altogether would break all of them. These tools/libs being Python 3 compatible themselves doesn't change that: if they use Robot's API that we remove, they will break.\r\n\r\nWe could just say that all tools/libs that are compatible with RF 5 should be Python-3-only and shouldn't use the old compatibility layer. Most likely most of them would be updated soon, but there likely are various projects that aren't actively maintained and updating could take time and in the worst case require finding a new maintainer. Breaking lot of projects isn't great, and in this case we can easily avoid that by preserving at least the most important parts of the compatibility layer. I strongly believe that's a good idea, especially because doing that is pretty easy.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think we should preserve the compatibility layer, I don't believe we should preserve it fully. The reason is that there are some utils that exists only to workaround bugs in old Jython and IronPython versions that nobody should be using anymore anyway. Some other utils are so specialized that I don't believe they are used at all. I believe we should preserve the most important parts and then add more utils back during the RF 5 preview release time or even after RF 5.0 release if needed.\r\n\r\nThis is what I think we should preserve:\r\n- `PY2`, `PY3`, `JYTHON`, `IRONPYTHON` and `JAVA_VERSION` constants\r\n- `py2to3` and `py3to2` class decorators\r\n- `is_unicode` function (could be an alias for `is_string`)\r\n- `unicode` type (could be an alias for `str`)\r\n- `unic` for safely converting values to Unicode (we still need this utility but it has been renamed to `safe_str`)\r\n\r\nThe following utils are likely not used a lot or at all. They can be preserved if needed:\r\n- `with_metaclass` for applying a metaclass\r\n- `StringIO` (`io.StringIO` works in most cases also with Python 2)\r\n- `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` (available in `collections` until Python 3.10)\r\n- `unwrap` for unwrapping decorators (available in `inspect` in Python 3)\r\n- `is_java_init` and `is_java_method` for detecting Java based methods\r\n\r\nI believe it's enough to document that the preserved utils are deprecated in RF 5. We can then later decide should we somehow more visible deprecate them. That would be pretty easy with functions but constants are a bit trickier. Most likely there's no actual maintenance or performance burden from preserving these utils so there's no urgent need to remove them either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4143","id":1052535480,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ84-vGq4","number":4143,"title":"\"Get Time\" keyword doesn't return accurate time delta if range includes daylight savings change","user":{"login":"chris-from-the-coast","id":63608024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjA4MDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63608024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast","html_url":"https://github.com/chris-from-the-coast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chris-from-the-coast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

Documentation has recommended using `formatter` already earlier, but now it's time to deprecated it more loudly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4134","id":1044884102,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ84-R6qG","number":4134,"title":"Assigments can have extra `=` in log if executed keyword does not exist","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

But because registered keyword arguments can be almost anything, Browser library can not define typing for the arguments and therefore Robot Framework can not perform automatic conversion to the arguments. There is an [issue](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/issues/1356) which demonstrates the problem when we do not perform the conversion. \r\n\r\nTherefore I was thinking to do conversion inside of the library.  I think it can be done if the run on failure keyword is one of the browser library keywords, because then library knows the argument specification. But the argument conversion is pretty complex problem to do, so I was thinking that I could use some Robot Framework code. Is there some entry point which would allow to do the conversion easily?

For example, the above could look like this in Finnish:\r\n```\r\n*** Asetukset ***\r\nDokumentaatio    Jotain dokua täällä.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting this done requires:\r\n1. Deciding how to enable support for different languages. Probably with a command line option like `--language FI`.\r\n2. Deciding how to handle multiple languages in one execution. Could be `--language FI --language EN` to allow customizing how a certain language is used e.g. like `--language FI:some:config`.\r\n3. Deciding what to translate. Section headers and settings for sure, but what about control structures like IF/ELSE? Perhaps we should allow translating everything and let translators to select do they want to use common IF/ELSE or some local variant. Could also be customizable when enabling support for a certain language.\r\n4. Getting translations for built-in support for common languages. These can be added in future releases.\r\n5. Deciding how to use languages that don't have built-in support. Perhaps `--language mylang.txt`.\r\n\r\nI hope the wider community can help with translations when we get that far. Comments about the design decisions above are appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nI consider making Robot Framework more native in non-English speaking languages pretty important and thus assign this to RF 5.0 scope with critical priority. The old issue about non-English Given/When/Then prefixes (#519) is highly related and already in RF 5.0 scope.\r\n\r\nThere are many other related enhancements like translating log and report, translating error message, translating keywords used in generic libraries, and so on.

This can make it difficult to diagnose test failures when multiple threads are involved, even with the use of the [`robotbackgroundlogger`](https://github.com/robotframework/robotbackgroundlogger).\r\n\r\nFor example, testing an application which makes requests (e.g. HTTP requests) to a server, where a dummy server is run as a separate background thread by the test framework (for tracking, inspecting and validating requests, producing dummy responses etc.), it would be really helpful to have logs from the server able to be logged to the same file(s) as the Robot tests and test infrastructure themselves, in the order they were logged by the respective threads. This would make it much easier to be able to correlate the logs from the different threads and quickly identify where failures are occurring.\r\n\r\nThe key thing doing this \"natively\" in `robotframework` gives (rather than via `robotbackgroundlogger`) is that this is immediately usable by all users of the framework, and doesn't require specific additional implementation by users. It also means the logs from the various threads are correctly interleaved in the order they were logged, whereas the `robotbackgroundlogger` logs the stored logs from background threads at a later point in time, requiring more steps to be able to reconstruct events.\r\n\r\nThis issue initially tracks just implementing this for the debug file (so that there is at least one method for getting these logs), however it would be beneficial to extend this to all log files if possible.\r\n\r\nAn initial attempt at fixing this issue (for the debug file only) is in https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/pull/3917.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4088","id":996684487,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ847aDLH","number":4088,"title":"Ability to register custom converters for keyword arguments","user":{"login":"DetachHead","id":57028336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI4MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57028336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead","html_url":"https://github.com/DetachHead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

I expect it to fail as if in case when the non-matching value was given to the keyword directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4039","id":945293484,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NDUyOTM0ODQ=","number":4039,"title":"Include information about chained exceptions in failure tracebacks","user":{"login":"Ka55i0peia","id":1867129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1867129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia","html_url":"https://github.com/Ka55i0peia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ka55i0peia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release with still open scope and timeline.

Currently tests can have tags to differentiate them, but explicit statuses would make the distinction more clear.\r\n\r\nThis functionality could be implemented so that new statuses are defined based on old statuses and tags. The specification could be given from the command like with a command line option like `--addstatus` with an argument in format such as `NEWSTATUS:OLDSTATUS:TAGPATTERN:COLOR`. In this spec `NEWSTATUS` would be the name of the new status to add, `OLDSTATUS` would be the old status to base this status on, `TAGPATTERN` would be the tag or tag pattern (e.g. `tag`, `tag:*` or `tag1ORtag2`) matching test must have, and `COLOR` would be the color associated with the status (possibly optional). Example:\r\n\r\n    --addstatus KNOWN_ISSUE:FAIL:bug-id-*:purple\r\n\r\nOne use case for this feature would be separating tests skipped explicitly during execution and tests skipped by the forthcoming `--skiponfailure` feature.
